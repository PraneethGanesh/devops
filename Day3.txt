DevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and 
benefits 
speed
rapid delivery
reliability
improve collaborations

Server
a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network
is a powerful computer or system that provide services or data to other computers known as clients, over the internet
Servers are designed to manage, store and process data and they play a critical role in handling request, delivering responses within a network
webserver
deliver web pages to users browsers
engine
*fileserver 
stores and manages files that clients can access that is share over a network
*database server 
manage the database and provide access to the client to read, write and update data
eg MySQL, MongoDB
mail server
handles the sending, receiving and storage of exchanges
eg microsoft exchange

1 Name of the server
2 Application and os Images(AMI)
	-os
3 Instance type: choose the number of CPU and ram
4 keypair: used to connect securely to an instance
5 networking :
	-firewalls
	-VPC: virtual private cloud
	-subnets
	-route table
	-NAT
	-Internet gateway
	-Elastic IPS
6 configuration:
	EBS(Elsatic Block store)
	EBS is nothing but similar to hard disk
	Persistent block level storage
	can create new volume and attach to running instance
7 Launch instance: web server/windows


 
THREE tier Architecture 

Load balancer -->to distribute the incoming application traffic to registered target called Server
autoscaling -->automatically add or remove server based on traffic and defined policy 
cloud watch alarm --> 
SNS-simple notification service

Horizontal Scaling
Vertical Scaling

load balancing
*automatically distributed across multiple target
*provide high availability
*Incorporate secure feature
*perform health check

ELB load balancer types:
application load balancer: http & https
network load balancer: TCP & UPD
gateway load balancer: IP
load balancer

Auto scaling
*help you control EC2 instance available to handle the load for your application
*Launch or terminate your AWS resource based on specific condition
*register new instance with load balancer when specified
