DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural 
the goal of DevOps is to shorten the software development lifecycle, improve collaborations, deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently
key elements :
1 automation 
2 continuous integration
3  continuous deployment 
4 collaboration and monitoring
Waterfall model: it has distinct goals for each phase of development
Waterfall model steps:
* Requirements
* Analysis 
* Design
* Coding
* Testing
* Operations

Limitation
Once the application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change some things that are not well thought out in the concept stages.
Agile Model
* plan
* design
* develop
* test
* deploy
* review
* launch
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity
in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can
develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few
virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add
capacity (scale up) to handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in
website traffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.
An EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. When you launch an EC2 instance, the
instance type that you specify determines the hardware available to your instance. Each instance
type offers a different balance of compute, memory, network, and storage resources
