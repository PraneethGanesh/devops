Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It enables automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of machines. Kubernetes helps organizations transition from host-centric to container-centric infrastructure, improving resource utilization and operational efficiency.
Kubernetes comes with a robust set of features for managing modern cloud-native applications:

Application centric management − Focuses on treating applications as top priority, making it easier to configure and run them automatically.
Automated deployment and scaling − Automatically adjusts workloads based on demand.
Auto scaling capabilities − Supports scaling up and down based on real-time demand.
Containerized infrastructure − Manages applications in containers across different machines, ensuring they are always available and portable.
Continuous development, integration, and deployment − Supports automated application updates and deployments using tools like Jenkins, ArgoCD, and Tekton.
Environment consistency across development, Testing, and Production − Ensures consistent environments across different stages using simple configurations.
Efficient resource utilization − Optimizes the use of CPU, memory, and storage with built-in policies.
Self healing and fault tolerance − Automatically restarts failed containers and replaces unhealthy nodes to maintain stability.
Advantages of Kubernetes
Kubernetes has many benefits that make it an important tool for managing applications in containers. Some of the main advantages are −

Scalability − Kubernetes can automatically scale applications up or down based on demand. It can handle dynamic traffic patterns and adjust resources accordingly.
High Availability − It ensures that your applications are always available. Kubernetes can automatically restart containers that fail, replace containers, and distribute workloads across nodes to avoid downtime.
Load Balancing − Kubernetes has built-in load balancing to distribute traffic across containers effectively, which enhances application performance and reduces the risk of server overload.
Self-Healing − Kubernetes automatically detects failed containers and replaces or restarts them, ensuring that the system remains healthy and applications continue to run without manual intervention.
Portability − Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing applications to run consistently across different environments (on-premises, cloud, or hybrid).
Cost Efficiency − Kubernetes enables better resource utilization by allowing applications to run on shared resources and scale efficiently.
