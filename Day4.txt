Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping and running applications. It has made life easier for developers and system administrators by simplifying the deployment of applications. Docker utilizes OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Docker containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything required to run an application: code, runtime, dependencies, and config files. By containerizing applications, Docker has paved the way for improved collaboration between developers and IT operations teams. It has become essential for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
